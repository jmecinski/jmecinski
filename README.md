ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Jakub MÄ™ciÅ„ski (also using nickname yoru in some places), aspiring JS/TS developer and huge Deno ğŸ¦• fan from Poland ğŸ‡µğŸ‡±. Currently gaining skills and knowledge to become full-stack web developer.

I mainly use JavaScript and TypeScript, developing web apps with Next.js, Tailwind CSS, shad/cn and Supabase.

- Swift/SwiftUI

- Python
- Kotlin Multiplatform

I plan to learn Go soon.
