ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Jakub MÄ™ciÅ„ski (also using nickname yoru in some places), currently gaining skills and knowledge to become full-stack web and mobile app developer.

I mainly use JavaScript and TypeScript, developing web apps with Next.js, Tailwind CSS, shadcn and Supabase or Appwrite.

I also had some episodes with:

I plan to learn Go and Kotlin Multiplatform soon.
